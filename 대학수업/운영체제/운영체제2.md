- I/O : 컴퓨터 및 주변장치에 대하여 데이터를 전송하는 프로그램, 운영 혹은 장치.
- Accounting : The Operating System tracks an account of all the functionalities taking place in the computer system at a time

### What is an Operating System?

- link between computer hardware and (system and application programs) which users can use.
- a program that allocates and deallocates computer system resources in an efficient, fair, and secure manner

### Purpose of a Computer System

- 효율적으로 툴을 사용하고 여러 문제를 풀기 위함.
- Computer systems consist of software and hardware that are combined to provide a tool to solve specific problems in an efficient manner.
- Execute programs

### Computer System Hardware (크게 세가지로 나눌 수 있다)

- Processor : CPU
- Memory : Ram / Rom
- Input, Output Devices : Keyboard / Mouse / hdd / CD / Monitor / printer .. 엄청 많음

### Single-user systems

---

- Personal computers - computer system dedicated to a single user.
- Interactive
- User convenience and responsiveness.
- 구체적인 시간에 단 한명의 유저가 이용해야 single-user system이라고 한다. single operation system working on that

### Batch systems (일괄 처리 시스템)

---

- ex. 10 users : 1 computer (operated by operator)
    - 10명의 유저가 disk를 이용해 program이나 process를 가져와야함.
- User ≠ operator
- Reduce setup time by batching similar jobs

### Memory(RAM) Layout

---

- RAM 32bit address → how much memory can i access? → 2^32 → 4GB
- operating system area와 user program area로 나눠져 있다.

### Multiprogrammed Systems

---

- Several jobs are kept in main memory at the same time, and the CPU is multiplexed among them.
- CPU Burst → CPU 명령을 실행하는 것  / I/O Burst → I/O 요청 후 기다리는 시간
- cpu가 쉬지 않게 I/O Burst 시간동안 다른 process의 cpu burst를 하는 시스템?

### OS Features Needed for Multiprogramming

---

- SPOOLing (Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On-Line)
- Spooling is a process in which data is temporarily held to be used and executed by a device, program, or system. 일시적으로 데이터를 보관한다 .
- Memory management
- CPU scheduling
- CPU Scheduling is **a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. cpu 자원을 관리하는? 배분하는? 그런 것이다.**

### Time-sharing Systems

---

- an interactive system with multiprogramming
- 여기 ppt 에 나오는 disk 는 보통 hard drive같은 것들을 말함

### Real-time Systems

---

- Well-defined fixed-time constraints. (조건부 시간제약 시스템?)
- 주어진 작업을 정해 놓은 시간 안에 완료해야 하는 시스템.
- often used as a control device in a dedicated application such as controlling scientific experiments, medical imaging system, industirial control systems, and some display systems.
- ex. ) ecg machine (심전도 체크 머신)
- hard real-time system
    - no virtual memory - Time cannot be wasted on translation of logical to physical addresses
    - os code structured for efficiency
- soft real-time system
    - useful in applications ( multimedia, virtual reality )
    - 

### Interrupts, Traps, and Signal

---

- from outside → interrupt
- 하드웨어적 흐름의 변화 / 프로그램 외부(I/O 장치, 디스크 등)에서 발생하며, 발생 시점이 일정하지 않기 때문에 비동기적
- 일단 얘네 셋이 dsiturbance라는 것을 설명하셨다.
- from inside → trap (exception, system call이 이에 해당함.)
- 소프트웨어적 흐름의 변화 / 소프트웨어 인터럽트라고도 하며, 프로그램 내부에서 일어나는 에러

### Interrupt Handling

---

ppt 잘 보도록 합시다

프로그램 A가 수행되고 있을 때 인터럽트가 발생하면 A의 현재 상태를 저장하게 됩니다.

현재 상태란 현재 CPU가 수행중이던 메모리 주소를 포함해 몇 가지 부가적인 정보(레지스터 값)들을 의미합니다.

이것을 모두 저장한 후에야 인터럽트 처리가 이루어질 수 있습니다.

### Hardware Protection

- Dual-Mode Operation
- I/O Protection
- Memory Protection
- CPU Protection

### Dual Mode Operation

---

- Sharing system resoursces requires operating system to ensure that an incorrect program cannot cause other programs to execute incorrectly.
- User mode - execution done on behalf of a user
- Monitor mode (kernel mode) - execution done on behalf of operation system.
- Mode bit added to computer hardware to indicate the current mode.
- mode bit : monitor mode (0) / user mode (1)
- When an interrupt or fault occurs hardware switches to monitor mode.

### I/O Protection

---

- All I/O instructions are privileged instructions
- *privilged instructions → can’t use in user mode only can use in kernel mode
- 멀티플 프로그램이 동시에 같은 I/O device에 접근하려고 할 때 필요함.(this is necessary when multiple programs try to access same I/O device)
- must ensure that a user program could never gain control of the computer in monitor mode.

### Memory Protection

---

- Must provide memory protection outside the address space of a process.
- In order to have memory protection, add two registers that determine the range of legal addresses a program may access : base register, limit register.
- Base register - holds the smallest legal physical memory address
- Limit register - contains the size of the range
- Use of Base and Limit Register
    
    ![[화면_캡처_2022-03-16_154942.png]]

### CPU Protection

---

to prevent CPU monopoly? CPU 독점을 막기 위해 필요함.

- Timer - interrupts computer after specified period to ensure operating system maintains controls.
    - timer is decremented every clock tick.
    - when timer reaches the value 0. an interrupt occurs.
- Timer commonly used to implement time sharing.
- Time also used to compute the current time.
- Load-timer is a privileged instructions

@ CPU Protection은 어떤 의미일까요?

```
// CPU도 I/O나 Memory처럼 자원이라고 볼 수 있습니다.

    > 왜냐하면 어떤 프로그램이 수행되기 위해서는 반드시 CPU가 필요합니다.

        .. 이 때에도 마찬가지로 독점하는 것이 문제가 됩니다.

```

@ 이를 Protection하기 위해서는 어떻게 하면 되는 것일까요?

```
// 어떤 job에게 허용한 시간을 타이머로 세팅을 해두면 됩니다.

    > 이 타이머가 종료가 되면 Interrupt가 발생하게 됩니다.

        .. 이게 발생하면 Mode Change가 일어나게 되고

        .. OS가 제어권을 확보하게 되고

        .. 그 프로그램은 CPU를 독점하지 않도록 뺄 수 있게 됩니다.

```

@ CPU Protection에서 중요한 Entity는 무엇이냐면,

```
// Timer Interrupt가 됩니다 (Counter register)

    > 이렇게 Counter register에 엑세스 하는 것도 Privileged Instruction입니다.

```

위에서부터 아래로 내려오는

API : Interface between applications(user) and system The **kernel**
 is a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program)
 at the core of a computer's [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)
 and generally has complete control over everything in the system.

Real work is done in the kernel

### System Calls

- [운영 체제](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%9A%B4%EC%98%81_%EC%B2%B4%EC%A0%9C)의 [커널](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%BB%A4%EB%84%90_(%EC%BB%B4%ED%93%A8%ED%8C%85))이 제공하는 [서비스](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%84%9C%EB%B9%84%EC%8A%A4)에 대해, [응용 프로그램](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%9D%91%EC%9A%A9_%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8)의 요청에 따라 커널에 접근하기 위한 [인터페이스](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%9D%B8%ED%84%B0%ED%8E%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4_(%EC%BB%B4%ED%93%A8%ED%8C%85))이다.
- System calls provide the interface between a process and an operating system.
- user program and op
- Types of system calls
    - Process Control (process execution)
    - File Management
    - Device Management
    - Information maintenance
    - Communications

### System call Execution

- Makes a call to a library function → library routine puts appropriate parameters at a well-known place → the trap instruction change mode from user to kernel → control goes to operationg system → operating system determines which system call is to be carried out

### Semantics of System Call Execution(syscall execution의 의미)

- Kernel indexes the dispatch table, which contains poitners to service routines for system calls
- Service routine is executed and return parmeter or error code placed at well-known places
- control given back to user program
- library function executes the instruction following trap

### Operating System Structures

- Simple Structure
- Layered Approach
- Microkernels
- Virtual Machines

---

### Simple Structures

- MS-DOS
- UNIX
    - consists of two seperable parts, the kernel and the system programs.

### Layered Approach
![[화면_캡처_2022-03-25_091239.png]]

- Modularity
- Each layer uses functions and services of only lower layers
- Simplifies debugging and system verification

### Microkernel

- ex.) mach, MacOS X Server, QNX, OS/2, and Windows NT
- structures the operating system by removing all non-essential components from the kernel and implementing them as system and user level programs.(basic)
- main function is to provide a communication facility between client programs and the various services thart are also running in the user space.
- easier to extend the OS / easier to maintain operating system code / OS is easier to port from one hardware to another / more security and reliablity
    
    ![[화면_캡처_2022-03-25_092246.png]]

    

### Virtual Machines

- Pioneered by IBM VM operating system that ran CMS, a single-user interactive operating system
- Difficult to implement
    ![[화면_캡처_2022-03-25_092759.png]]

    

### System Design and Implementation

---

- User : 사용하기 쉽고 배우기 쉽고 안전하고 빨라야함.
- operating system should be convenient to use, easy to learn, reliable, safe, and fast.
- System designer and administrator :  디자인 하기 쉽고 구현하기 쉽고 유지보수하기 쉽고 유동적이며 안정적이고 에러의 영향을 받지 않으며 효율적 이어야 함.
- easy to design, implement, and maintain, as well as flexible, reliable, error-free, and efficient.
- Mechanism : determine how to do something ( ex. 방을 어떤 방식으로 다섯개로 나눌 것인가.)
- Policy : determine what will be done (ex. 방을 다섯개로 나눌 것이다.)
- Implementation in :
    - Assembly language
    - Higher level languages :
        - Easier to code
        - Compact code
        - Easier to port

### Introduction to UNIX and Linux

- Written by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thomsom in at bell labs in 1969
- most popular operating systems

### UNIX / Linux File System

- UNIX has a hierarchical(계층형) file system structure consisting of a root directory.
- In a command-line user interface, typed commands are used to navigate the system.
- directories and files are specified by filenames

---

### What is a process?

---

- a program in execution; process execution must progress in sequential fashion
- A process consists of:
    - code (text) section
    - data section
    - Stack
    - Heap
    - Environment
    - CPU state
    - Process control block

### CPU and I/O Bound Processes

---

- I/O-bound process - spends more time doing I/O than computations, many short CPU bursts
- CPU-bound process - spends more time doing computations; few very long CPU bursts

### Process States

- new : The process is being created.
- ready: The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor
- running: Instructions are being executed by cpu
- waiting: The process is waiting for some event to occr.
- terminated: The process has finished execution.
- admitted → 입장을 허락 받은

### CPU Switch From Process to Process (Scheduling)
![[화면_캡처_2022-03-31_094428.png]]
- user가 보기에는 모든 process가 한번에 running 하고 있는 것처럼 보이지만 실제로는 one time only one process executed by the cpu , cpu is switching between multple program at the multiple time.

### Process Scheduling Queues

- Job queue - set of all processes in the system
- Ready queue - set of all processes residing in main memory, ready and waiting to execute.
- Device queues(I/O queue) - set of processes waiting for I/O devices.
- Process migration between the various queues.

### Queues in a Computer System
![[화면_캡처_2022-03-31_095442.png]]

time slice expired → 시간 초과하면 ready queue 로 다시 돌아감.

I/O queue → 이런게 Device queue이다.

### Schedulers

- Long term scheduler(장기) selects processes from the job pool to be brought into the ready queue.
    - invoked very infrequently (seconds, minutes) ⇒ may be slow.
    - The long-term scheduler controls the degree of multiprogramming.
    - More processes, smaller percentage of time each process is executed.
- Short term scheduler(단기) selects which process should be executed next and allocates it the CPU through the dispatcher.
    - Short-term scheduler is invoked very frequently (miliseconds) ⇒ muste be fast.
    - Invoked when following events occur
        - 엄청 다양함.
- Medium term scheduler(중기) → also known as swapper

### Context Switch

- When Cpu switches to another process, the system must save the state(context) of the ‘current’ (old) process and load the saved state for the new process.

### Process Creation

- Parent process create children processes
- Resource sharing (세 가지 case가 있다.)
    - parent and children share all resources
    - children share a subset(일부) of parent’s resources
    - parent and child share no resources.
- Execution (두 가지 case가 있다.)
    - Parent and children execute concurrently(동시에 진행하다)
    - Parent waits until children terminate.
- Address space (두 가지)
    - Child duplicate of parent.
    - Child has a program loaded onto it.
- UNIX examples
    - ‘fork’ system call creates a new process
    - ‘exec’ system call used after a ‘fork’ to replace the process memory image with a new executable.

### Process Termination

- process executes the last statement and requests the operating system to terminate it( in unix, and linux ‘exit’)
- Parent may terminate execution of children processes (’abort’)

### Process Management in UNIX/Linux

- Important process-related UNIX/Linux system calls
    - fork
        - fork 호출된 개수 n / 2^n개의 프로세스가 된다.
        - when this is executed, a new process is created which consists of copy of the address space of the parent.
        - 새로운 프로세스 공간을 별도로 만들고, fork() 시스템 콜을 호출한 부모 프로세스 공간의 데이터을 모두 복사한다.
        - this mechanism allows the parent process to communicate easily with the child process.
        - fork() - sample code
            ![[화면_캡처_2022-04-04_104958.png]]
            
    - fork() - child differs from the parent
        - Different PID / Different parent process ID(PPID) / child has its own copy of parent’s file descriptors / etc.
    - fork() - reasons for failure
        - maximum number of processes allowed to execute under one use has exceeded
        - (한 번의 사용으로 실행 가능한 최대 프로세스 수가 초과되었습니다.)
        - maximum number of processes allowed on the system has exceeded
        - not enough swap space
    - wait
        - zombie process - a process that has terminated but whose exit status has not yet been received by its parent or by init.
    - exec
        - 덮어쓰기 같은 것
        - typically the exec system call is used after a fork system call.
        - the new process image is construscted from an ordinary, executable file.
        - there can be no return from a succesful exec because the calling process image is overlaid by the new process image
    - exit

### Cooperating Processes

---

- Independent process cannot affect or be affected by the execution of another process.
- Cooperating process can affect or be affected by the execution of another process.
- Advantages of process cooperation
    - information sharing
    - computation speed-up
    - modularity
    - convenience

### Producer-Consumer Problem

---

- Paradigm for cooperating processes, producer process produces information that is consumed by a consumer process.
- unbounded-buffer places no practical limit on the size of the buffer
- bounded-buffer assumes that there is a fixed buffer size
    ![[화면_캡처_2022-04-06_093248.png]]
    
    - 버퍼 → 임시 저장 공간.
    - bounded buffer → 유한하다. / unbounded buffer → 무한하다.
- Producer Process / Counsumer Process 찾아보기
- (in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE == out ⇒ 꽉 차 있으면 아무것도 만들지 않는다.
- in == out ⇒ 아무것도 consume 하지 않는다.

### Interprocess Communication (IPC)

---

- Mechanism for process to communicate
- Message system - processes communicate with each other without resorting to shared variables.
- IPC facility provides two operations:
    - Send(message) - message size fixed or variable
    - Receive (message)

### Direct Communication

---

- Processes must name each other explicityly
    - send (P, message) - send a message to process P
    - Receive(Q, message) - receive a message from process Q

### Indirect Communication

---

- Messages are directed and received from mailboxes (also reffered to as ports).
    - Each mailbox has a unique id.
    - Process can communicate only if they share a mailbox.
- Primitives are defined as:
    - send (A, message)
    - receive(A, message)

### Synchronization

---

- Message passing may be either blocking or non-blocking
- Blocking is considered as a synchronous
- None-blocking is considered asynchronous

### Buffering

---

- Queue of messages attached to the link; implemented in one of three ways.
    - Zero capacity - No messages
        - Sender must wait for receiver
    - Bounded capacity - n messages
        - Sender must wait if link full.
    - Unbounded capacity - infinite length
        - Sender never waits.

### UNIX/Linux IPC  Tools

- Pipe
    - For communication between related processes on a system.
    - they have some relationship between each other. (ex. parent - child)
    - half-duplex communication
        - bi-directional (양방향)
        - at a specific time only one process can send message and other can just receiving
    - full-duplex communication
        - bi-directional (양방향)
        - at same time processes can send message to each other.
- Named pipe (FIFO)
    - For communication between unrelated processes on a system
- BSD socket ( Berkeley Software Distribution )
    - For communication between unrelated processes on the same or different systems
    - can be created on the same or different systems
- TLI
- Message queue
- Shared memory

### File Descriptors in UNIX/Linux

- An integer returned by open() system call
- used as an index in the per process file descriptor table(PPFDT)
- Used in read, write, and close calls
- Size of PPFDT is equal to the number of files that a process can open simultaneously (OPEN_MAX in Linux—see <linux/limits.h>

### File Descriptor to File Contents

![[화면_캡처_2022-04-11_200220.png]]

starting address 가 inode table에서 return 된다.

### Standard Descriptor in UNIX/Linux

- Three files are automatically opened for every process for the process  to read its input from and send its output and error messages to. These files are called standard files : standard input, standard output, and standard error
- By default, standard files are attached to the terminal on which a process runs
- Descriptors for standard files are known as standard file descriptors.
    - standard input: 0 (keyboard)
    - standard output: 1 (display screen)
    - standard error: 2(display screen)

### UNIX/Linux Pipe

- Important system calls
    - pipe : create pipe for IPC
        - int pipe (int pipedes[2]); (2 file descriptor reading and writing)
        - ex) pipedes[0] → reading pipedes[1] → writing
        - call fails
            - at least two slots not empty in the PPFDT - too many files or pipe open in the process
            - Buffer space not available in the kernel
            - File table is full
    - open : Open or create a file
        - int open (const char *path, int oflag, /* mode_t mode */ ..);
        - ppt 참고 ‘oflag’ → 파일 상태 플래그 읽기용, 쓰기용, 둘다 가능하게 할 것 인지의 플래그
            - O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR, O_NDELAY 등등
        - returns a file descriptor(index) on success and -1 on failure
        - can specify that read and write will be blocking or non-blocking
        - ‘oflag’ value is constructed by ORing various flags : 다양한 종류 ppt 확인
        - Call fails
            - non-existent file
            - operation specifed is not allowed due to file permissions
            - search not allowed  on a component of pathname
            - User’s disk quota(한도) on the file system has been exhausted
            - no write permission on the directory
            - signal was caught during open
            - process has reached the limit of maximum pen files
            - system limit reached on maximum number of simultaneous open files
    - read : Read from a pipe
        - ssize_t read(int fildes, void *buf, size_t nbytes);
            - // fildes : 파일 기술자, buf : 바이트를 저장할 메모리 영역의 시작 주소, nbytes : 읽어올 바이트 수
        - returns number of bytes read or -1
        - call fails and errno(error number) set accordingly
            - Invalid ‘fildes’, ‘buf’, or ‘nbyte’
            - signal caught during read ( got some interrupt from data )
    - write : write data to a pipe
        - ssize_t write(int fildes, const void *buf, size_t nbytes);
            - // fildes : 파일 기술자, buf : 바이트를 저장할 메모리 영역의 시작 주소, nbytes : 읽어올 바이트 수
        - returns the number of bytes written or -1
        - call fails
            - invalid argument
            - file size limit for process or for system would exceed
            - disk is full
        
    - close : close/destroy a pipe
    - Important characteristics of a pipe
        - Stream of bytes
        - Used as half-duplex channel ( at one time only one communcation will be done )
        - Bounded buffer
        - Maximum data written is PIPE_BUF 5120 and 4096, respectively
    
    Sample Code 영상 다시 보기
    
    - close(pipefd[0]) → Read blocked because while i writing nobody can’t read
    - /*Parent’s Code*
        - 예시 코드에서는 parent는 아무것도 writing 하지 않으므로 close(pipefd[1])한다.
        - nr = read(pipefd[0], buf, n); → read from the pipe
        - rc = write(1, buf, nr); 1 ⇒ stdoutput (writing down on screen directly)

### Command Line Use of Pipes

- connect standard output of a command to standard input of another
- use the pipe operator, |
- Syntax : cmd1 | cmd2 | ... | cmdN
    ![[화면_캡처_2022-04-15_155833.png]]
    
    하나의 파이프가 두개의 명령을 하는 것과 마찬가지이다.
    

### Input, Output, Error Redirection

- You can use the Linux redirection featues to detatch the default files from stdin, stdout, and stderr and attach other files with them.
- when i don’t want to print err on my screen but i want to make err log.
    - 리다이렉션을 이용하면 명령의 출력을 바꿀 수 있다.
    - 모니터에 출력 안하고 파일에 기록하는 것이 가능
- Input Redirection :
    - command < input - file
    - command 0< input-file (여기서 0는 std input을 말함.)
    - purpose: detach keyboard from stdin and attach ‘input-file’ to it, i.e.(that is ),
    ’command’ reads input from ‘input-file’ and not keyboard.
    - ppt 및 강의 참고
- Output Redirection:
    - command > output-file
    - command 1> output-file
    - purpose: Detach the display screen from stdout and attach ‘output-file’ to it, i.e., 
    ’command’ sends output to ‘output-file’ and not the display screen.
- Error Redirection:
    - command 2> error-file
    - purpose: Detach the display screen from stderr and attach ‘error-file’ to it, i.e., error messages are sent to ‘error-file’ and not the display screen.

### UNIX/Linux FIFOs / (named Pipe)

- IPC for communication between related or unrelated processes on a computer.
- unrealted process에서 더 많이 쓰인다고 한다.
- A file type in UNIX
- Created with mknod() or mkfifo() system call or by mkfifo command
- Unlike a pipe, a FIFO must be opened before using it for communication
- a wrtie to a FIFO that no process has opened for reading results in a SIGPIPE signal
- when the last process to write to a FIFO closes it, and EOF(end of the file) is sent to the reader
- multiple process can write to a FIFO  → atomic writes to prevent interleaving of mulitple wirtes
(one time only one will be writing) 다양한 프로세스가 한번에 write할 수 있지만 한 프로세스는 하나만 할 수 있다? 약간 그런 느낌인듯. multiple process can write to a FIFO at multiple times
- Atomic operation? : 끼어들기가 불가능하며, 만일 중지되면 동작 개시 직전의 상태로 시스템을 복귀시킬 것을 보증하는 복구(백업과 복원)기능이 제공된다.
- Two common uses of FIFOs
    - in client-server applications, FIFOs are use to pass data between a server process and client processes
        ![[화면_캡처_2022-04-15_163818.png]]
        
    - used by shell commands to pass data from one shell pipeline to another, without creating temporary files

### Creating FIFOs

- mknod system call
    - int mknod(const char *path, mode_t mode, dev_t dev)
    - Designed to create special(device) files ( i/o device??)
    - ‘mode’ should be permission mode OR-ed with S_IFIFO
    - ‘dev’ is set to 0 for  FIFO
    - mknod fails
        - file with the given names exists
        - pathname too long
        - a component in the pathname not searchable, non-existent, or non-directory
        - Destination directory is read-only
        - not enough memory space available
        - signal caught during mknod
- mkfifo command
- mkfifo C library call
    - int mkfifo(const char *path, mode_t mode);
    - ‘mode’ sets permission on FIFO vb
    - Invokes mknod system call
    - ‘mode’ sets permission on FIFO
    - Calls mknod
    - mkfofo fails: 거의 똑같음
        - signal caught during mkfifo

ppt 참고

### Command Line Use of FIFOs

- $ mkfifo fifo1  (create fifo)
- $ prog3 < fifo1 &
- $ prog1 < infile | tee fifo1 | prog2
- [output]
    ![[화면_캡처_2022-04-23_232300.png]]
    

위 명령의 결과

- tee → 표준 입력(standard input)에서 읽어서 표준 출력(standard output) 과 파일에 쓰는 명령어.
- `echo "hello" | tee OUTFILE` *OUTFILE* 을 *NEWFILE* 로 복사합니다.
- w -ls → 실행 결과나 파일의 줄 수를 센다.

### Client-Server Code

- ppt 보고 이해

### Running The Code (위의 client-server code 실행시키기)

- $ gcc server.c -o server
- $ gcc client.c -o server
- server &
- [1] 432056 (id for FIFO)
- client
- Hello, server !
- Hello, clients!

### Managing UNIX/Linux processes

- ps - display status of processes
- top - display CPU usage(사용량) of processes
- bg - Put a process in the background
- fg - bring a process into the foreground
- jobs - Display status of jobs
- <Ctrl-Z> - suspend(연기하다) / stop a process
- <Ctrl-C> - send SIGINT signal to the foreground process
- kill - terminate a process

### Issues with Processes

- The fork() system call is expensive ( 같은 resource를 copy하기 때문에 )
- IPC is required to pass information between a parent and its child processes.
    - PIPE나 FIFO 활용이 필수적이다. different process 이기 때문에.

```c
// HW # 3 & 4 19010962 이종혁
// Question # 5 (c)
#define MAX RESOURCES 5
int available_resources = MAX RESOURCES;
semaphore mutex = 1;

int decrease_count(int count)
{
	if (available_resources >= count)
	{
			wait(&mutex);
			available_resources -= count;
			signal(&mutex);
			return 1;
	}
	return 0;
}

semaphore mutex = 1;

void increase_count(int count)
{
	wait(&mutex);
	available_resources += count;
	signal(&mutex);
}

```
